# chof64/opg-chadfernandez-me

OPG is an Open Graph image generator built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and the [next-api-og-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-api-og-image) package. The package helps us generate an image with a serverless function using a headless chromium browser.

## The Problem

Open Graph allows us to define metadata for our websites and pages. And this metadata is used when sharing our page on other websites. And when you have lots of pages, generating OG Images for them can be tedious.

The challenge is to create an API that will automate the generation of OG Images.
